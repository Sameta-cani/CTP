## Project Structure

The repository is organized into several directories, each containing specific sets of problems and challenges:

- **CodeUp**: Basic Python exercises designed to strengthen your foundational skills.
- **Baekjoon**: Algorithmic challenges from the Baekjoon Online Judge platform, which is popular among competitive programmers.
- **Programmers**: A collection of challenges from the Programmers platform, focusing on various levels of coding problems.
- **Goormlevel**: Specific problem sets like binary conversion tasks to enhance your understanding of algorithms.
- **이취코테**: Advanced challenges typically found in coding interviews and technical assessments.
  
Each directory contains multiple files and subdirectories, organized by the type or difficulty of the problems.

## Getting Started
To start using this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine using the command:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Sameta-cani/CodeChallenger.git
```
2. **Navigate** to the relevant directory to explore the problems. For example:
```bash
cd CodeChallenger/CodeUp
```
3. Open and read the problem files, which are typically in Python (`.py`) format. Solve the problems by writing your code directly into these files or by creating new ones as needed.

## Usage

### Running the Challenges
Each challenge is designed to be run independently. Here's how you can run and test your solutions:

1. **Open the problem file** in your preferred code editor.
2. **Implement your solution** in the file. Each problem may include comments or templates to help you get started.
3. **Run the file** to test your solution. Use Python to execute the file:
```bash
python filename.py
```

4. If there are test cases included, ensure your solution passes all of them.
   
### Adding New Challenges

If you have new challenges or problems that you think would be a great addition to the repository, you can add them by:

1. Creating a new file in the appropriate directory.
2. Writing a clear problem statement and sample input/output in the file comments.
3. Implementing your solution or providing a starting template for others.
